# Workload-Forecasting
Welcome to this project! In the world of financial services, where vast amounts of sensitive data are processed daily, efficient workforce management is crucial for seamless operations. This project focuses on building a time series forecasting model to predict the workload associated with processing large volumes of financial documents, specifically checks, for the upcoming months. By providing early insights into expected workload, this model enables optimal workforce allocation, ensuring high-demand periods are met with sufficient resources for smooth, secure operations.

## Project Overview
As digital transformation accelerates, organizations are increasingly tasked with managing extensive data and transaction flows securely. For companies handling financial document processing, understanding monthly volume trends is essential for meeting service demands without disruption. This project leverages historical data to build a reliable forecasting model that supports effective workforce planning and ensures continuous operational efficiency.

The primary goals of this project are to:
1. Accurately forecast monthly check volumes to anticipate workload fluctuations.
2. Optimize workforce distribution by identifying peak volume periods for targeted resource allocation.
3. Enhance operational resilience by reducing response times during high-demand intervals, ultimately supporting a seamless processing experience.
